# The file defines the configuration for simple Nauachia challenge where a
# sucessful man-in-the-middle (MTIM) attack (such as ARP poisoning) provides a
# solution

# If you are unfamiliar with docker-compose this might be helpful:

# But the gist is that the services block below specifies two containers, which
# act as parties in a vulnerable communication
