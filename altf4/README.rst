Alt F4 for Ops
==============

*Did you know that Alt-F4 is the shortcut for ops in IRC?*

**Scenario**: The challenger is on an L2 segment with an IRC client and has L3 access to a segment with 2 more IRC
clients and an IRC server. The server is being used as a C2 platform for a number of (fake) bitcoin miners. One of the
IRC clients on the second L2 segment is the botmaster and has exclusive operator privileges. To get the flag, the
challenger must use the other bot client on as a platform to sniff the operator password and log, into the IRC server
and join the restricted channel.
